		<h2>Introduction to VARK</h2>
		<p>VARK, which stands for Visual, Aural, Read/Write, and Kinesthetic sensory modalities which are used in education. To see how each of these are defined, you can find out more <a href="modules.php">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>This inventory was initially developed in 1987 by Neil Fleming to present some questions with helpsheets for students, teachers and others to use in their own way.
		</p><p>
		To learn more about VARK, its origins and to see interviews with the designer of VARK, especially as applied to educational use, you can find out more <a href="http://vark-learn.com/introduction-to-vark/">here</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Some other important factors about VARK include:</p>
		<p>
		<ul>
		<br><li>Preferences are not the same as strengths</li>
		<br><li>VARK is about learning not leisure</li>
		<br><li>If you have completed the questionnaire with empathy, you will have indicated the preferences of others - not your own learning preferences. They may not indicate how you teach, train, or work with others!</li>
		<br><li>Preferences may be masked by life and work experiences</li>
		<br>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Understanding the Results</h2>
		<p>The results are not something that should be applied rigidly as the questionnaire doesn't intend to box respondents into a mindset that they have been 'diagnosed'.

		<p>If you received multimodal as a result, it means you do not have a standout mode with one preference score above te others and so need to process information is more than one mode to get a thorough and satisfying understanding.
		<br>There are two types: those who are flexible in their communication preferences and those who switch from mode to mode depending on what they are working with.
